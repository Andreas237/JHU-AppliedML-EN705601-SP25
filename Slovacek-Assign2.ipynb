    "With an unknown dataset, I would likely try the SVM first.  If I knew that the dataset had relatively few features (less than say 20), then I would use a decision tree for its speed and simplicity.  I've seen decision trees perform very well on tasks that took deep neural networks incredible amounts of data and time. The following paper is just such an example [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perceptron: Minimizes the error in predictions. It is not statistical, but does solve an optimization (minimization) problem. It's a relatively weak/unrobust algorithm, because it will never converge if data isn't linearly separable.  It doesn't have kernel methods available and thus can't add dimensions to make hyperplanes evident.  The perceptron relies on numeric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM: algorithm for classification and regression.  Data must be linearly separable unless the \"kernel trick\" is utilized. Maximizes the distance between classes of data. SVMs perform better with high dimension data than decision trees [2]. Can use a variety of methods for optimization-- radial basis function, sigmoid, polynomial, linear. It is not statistical, but does solve optimization (maximization) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree: an algorithm for classification.  Create a rule for a subset, or all of, the features in the dataset. Great for nominal data and numeric data. The logic of a decision tree is easy to interpret. Doesn't require feature scaling.  Not as robust as Random Forest-- more susceptible to overfitting and doesn't generalize as well [1]. It is stastical in that it's looking for things like averages/means, medians, and modes. Quick and easy to train if the dataset has few features or is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random forest: ensemble learner for classification and regression. Generalizes well due to how trees are generated [1]. It is stastical because it is derived from decision trees. More time consuming to train than a decision tree, since you are generating multiple decision trees."

    "### Answer 2\n",
    " - Numerical: characteristics of features represented by numerical values.  In the Iris dataset `petal length`, `petal width`, `sepal length`, `sepal width` are all numeric features.\n",
    " - Nominal: are descriptive features, without numerica characteristics.  On Kaggle there is a dataset named [Vehicle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho).  The `Name` feature contains information on the make, model and trim level of the car, which are each features in themselves.\n",
    " - Date: These features indicate a time related to the sample.  They can be values such as `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `millisecond`, or a combination of all of those.  The [Vehicle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) contains `year`. Another dataset with more date features is [Room Occupancy Estimation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation) which contains `date` and `time` features.  `date` is formatted as YYYY/MM/DD, `time` is formatted as HH:MM:SS.\n",
    " - Text: these are sentences, or words.  They are used in tasks like sentiment analysis, or perhaps something like classifying a support ticket as \"hardware issue\" or \"finance issue.\"  An example of a sentiment analysis dataset is the [Customer Feedback Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishweshsalodkar/customer-feedback-dataset) on Kaggle.  The dataset shows only one feature, `Text, Sentiment, Source, Date/Time, User ID, Location, Confidence Score`, but on inspection we can see that the first field in this single feature is itself a `text` feature.  Another dataset rich with text is the [Support-tickets-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniketg11/supportticketsclassification) dataset on Kaggle.  It contains text features `title` and `body` which can be used to determine what team is responsible for the ticket.\n",
    " - Image: image features are just that--images.  From what I've read it appears these are always transformed into RGB with values (0,255).  An example dataset is the [AI vs. Human-Generated Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset).  This dataset contains a CSV with relative paths to image files, the feature is called `file_name`.  Another example of images in a dataset is [Olivetti Faces](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#olivetti-faces-dataset) which I reviewed on Scikit-Learn's website.  The dataset has an `images` feature which has 400 samples, each of which is 64x64 matrix of grayscale image values.\n",
    " - Dependent variable: this is a variable which is determined by features (or independent variables).  In the Iris dataset these are the species Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolour, Iris-Virginica.\n",
